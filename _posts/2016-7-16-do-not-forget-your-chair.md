title: Don't forget the chair!
---

For as long as I can remember I have been sitting on one of those leather chairs you can grab at office depot for $100 to $200. I spent most of my days sitting and this would eventually lead to me doing an asian squat, alternating legs underneath each other to relieve some of the pressure. 

It wasn't too uncomfortable when I was younger but I am getting older and also working at an administrative job for little over a year have taken its toll on my body. My terrible posture is starting to catch up with me.
A dull pain started forming on my right wrist to elbow and I knew it was time to take action before it got worse. I ordered an ergonomic mouse and keyboard and snagged an old herman miller aeron to use at my work desk.
This seems to have helped at work but afterwards when I come home, I'm on my desk for another few hours as well. 
I start scouring the internet for some affordable ergonomic chairs. In the end it came down to Herman Miller Aeron and Steelcase Leap v2. 

It is really hard coming to a conclusion on anything when reading reviews on the internet. Views on the Aeron is either a love it or hate it review. The leap v2 reviews seem pretty consistent. What I recommened is that you look at your local listings for used office furniture to see if they have either in stock and try them out! This is the route I took and was able to test out used Aerons and Leaps at the store. I spent so much time trying to figure out what would be best for me online but fastest and most efficient way was actually trying them. 

I spent a ton of time sweating in the head upstairs going to each chair and sitting on them and came to the following conclusions:

I went with the used leap and the reasons are: 
    the elbow rests are goddamed amazing. Being able to narrow them, push them back, angle them, and just customize the position was one feature I needed. The office depot chairs put me in shrugged position at home. The lumbar support is amazing, being able to customize the tension and the position. The reclining feels really smooth, with the seat sliding out while you recline back. The seat is a bit stiff but it's company has said this is be design and not a missed flaw. 

I didn't go with the Aeron because: 
    It was just too stiff, even though the seat was comfortable. The eblow rests can be angled but they cannot narrowed like the Leaps. When you recline back the arm rests recline back as well. For me this is very awkward because I like have a more relaxed position when using the computer at home. It's a pretty comfortable chair but too stiff for me.

It feels weird not asian squatting or sitting crossed legged in my chair but my god my posture and arms feel amazing. I wished I had bought one sooner. I feel more productive working because I'm not readjusting due to discomfort. One caveat of the leap is that the seat can get warm but the tradeoffs are worth it. As I type this right now in great posture, my message for today is don't forget about your chair.'
